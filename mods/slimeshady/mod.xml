    <Description>A ReShade mod by slimebucket. Brighter colors
  
    - Uses: Colorness,  Vibrance
	
	Misc Texture replacement pack has many misc textures for objects and NPC's that are not in any other mod.
	The NPC's this mod replaces only will work during story. The way NPC textures work,
	you need  different texture sheet for every combination of party you can have, making some NPC's need
	like 32 duplicates of the the same texture. This mod doesnt do that. 
	It upscales NPC's during the story, where your party is locked and forced to be certian members.
	So during story moments the NPC's will be upscaled, but if you go back to those NPC's later On
	in the game, chances are, they will no longer look upscaled.</Description>
